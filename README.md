# Fixium - PocketMine Plugin for MCPE 0.15.10

Fixium is a PocketMine plugin (MCPE 0.15.10) developed by **HighLights** designed to improve server performance and facilitate server analysis through snapshots and complementary tools.

---

## Introduction

Fixium allows capturing and analyzing server performance snapshots, storing key data such as memory, entities, players, and TPS (Ticks Per Second). It is part of a modular ecosystem specialized in improving server stability and optimization.

This project is ideal for server admins who want to monitor and optimize their PocketMine servers easily and visually.

## Included Modules

Fixium consists of several modules that can be enabled or configured as needed:

### 1. TOD (TickOverloadDetector)  
Detects plugins and their load speed in milliseconds (MS), helping identify which plugins take longer and consume more resources.

### 2. EntityFix  
Cancels the spawning of empty or invalid entities (null or closed entities).

### 3. AutoCleaner  
Removes ownerless objects or entities automatically to reduce server clutter and lag.

### 4. WorldLoader  
Preloads worlds before the server starts to prevent bugs when players enter them.

### 5. ChunkFreezeFix  
Unloads frozen chunks (chunks without entities or activity) to save resources.

### 6. FixiumProfiler  
Integrated tool for collecting and analyzing performance data via snapshots, compatible with Fixium Graphic Maker (FGM).

## How to use Fixium Graphic Maker (FGM)

FGM is a web application created to interpret and visually display snapshots generated by Fixium.

### Steps to use FGM:

1. Locate the `snapshots/` folder inside the Fixium directory on your server.  
2. Open the `.fxm` snapshot file you want to analyze.  
3. Copy the line starting with `encoded: ...` (example:  
   `encoded: eyJ0IjoiMjAyNS0wNi0xNSAyMzozNjoxMCIsIm0iOjI2LCJlIjowLCJwIjowLCJ0cHMiOjIwfQ==`)  
4. Paste this code into the text field on the FGM web page.  
5. Click "Generate Chart" to visualize your server's performance data.  
6. Compare with previous snapshots to detect improvements or issues.
